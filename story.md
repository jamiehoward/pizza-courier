# NEON SLICE: Pizza Courier

## The World

### Neo Angeles, 2087

The megacity stretches endlessly under a sky permanently stained orange from atmospheric processors. After the Cascade—a catastrophic grid failure that collapsed society's infrastructure—the world rebuilt itself on the bones of the old. Corporations rose from the ashes, carving the city into sectors they control like feudal lords.

Power is everything. Literally.

The grid is fragmented. Different sectors run on different networks, different currencies, different rules. But one thing remains universal: **energy is life**. Those who control electricity control everything. Those who can't afford it live in the dark zones—vast swaths of the city where buildings stand hollow and streetlights haven't worked in decades.

In this world, the fastest way to move freely between sectors isn't a car (too traceable), a drone (too regulated), or walking (too slow). It's a **hoverboard**—street-legal, nimble, and powered by scavenged ambient electricity from the city itself.

## The Character

### Jen Nakamura

**Age:** 22  
**Origin:** Dark Zone District 7  
**Occupation:** Independent Courier (Pizza Specialist)

Jen grew up in the shadows of dead skyscrapers, learning early that survival meant being fast, fearless, and forgettable. Her mother was an engineer who worked on the original power grid before the Cascade; her father vanished during the collapse.

She inherited her mother's technical brilliance and her father's restlessness.

When she was sixteen, Jen built her first hoverboard from salvaged drone parts and a burned-out transit rail capacitor. It barely held together, but it was fast. More importantly, it was *freedom*—a way out of the dark zones and into the neon-lit streets where credits flowed and opportunity existed.

Now she runs pizza for **Rico's Real Slice**—one of the last independent restaurants in the Central Sector. It's honest work. The pay is steady. And it keeps her moving through the city, learning its secrets, making connections that might one day matter.

But delivering pizza is just the beginning.

**Personality:**
- Quick-witted and sarcastic
- Fiercely independent, distrustful of corporations
- Loyal to those who earn it
- Secretly idealistic—believes the city can be fixed

**Skills:**
- Expert hoverboard rider (self-taught)
- Basic electronics and salvage expertise
- Extensive knowledge of city shortcuts and back routes
- Unnervingly calm under pressure

## The Hoverboard

### The "Spark" Mark IV

Jen's board isn't pretty, but it's *hers*. Built from salvaged parts across three years of upgrades, the Spark runs on **ambient energy harvesting**—siphoning electricity from the city's electromagnetic field.

**Core Mechanics:**

#### Energy Charge System
The board's capacitor charges passively while in motion, drawing power from:
- Street-level EM fields (from underground transit lines)
- Building electromagnetic emissions  
- Car exhaust ionization trails
- **Near-miss energy spikes** (the closer you cut it, the more you harvest)

The charge meter fills as Jen rides. When full, she can unleash that stored power in two ways:

#### Boost Mode (Shift)
Release all stored charge in a burst of speed—perfect for outrunning trouble or making impossible delivery windows.

#### Flight Mode (Space + Shift)
Combine charge release with a jump to activate limited anti-gravity flight. The board's lift generators are powerful but hungry—flight drains energy fast. Use it to reach rooftops, shortcut over traffic jams, or escape pursuit.

**Upgrade Path:**
- Larger capacitor = longer flight time
- Better harvesters = faster charging
- Improved repulsors = higher altitude ceiling
- Sleeker design = reduced drag, higher top speed

## The Pizza Shop

### Rico's Real Slice

Tucked in the Central Sector's market district, Rico's is an anomaly—a family business in a city of franchises. Rico himself is a third-generation pizzaiolo who refused to sell out when the megacorps came knocking.

The shop is Jen's home base:
- **Pick up orders** for delivery throughout the city
- **Upgrade your board** in Rico's back room workshop
- **Accept special jobs** from Rico's network of contacts
- **Rest and save** between runs

Rico pays fair, tips when you're fast, and doesn't ask questions about the other jobs you're running. He's seen enough couriers come and go to know that pizza is rarely anyone's only hustle.

## Core Gameplay Loop

### Pizza Delivery (Primary Income)

1. Pick up pizza from Rico's
2. Race through the city to the delivery location
3. Beat the timer for bonus pay
4. Return for the next order

**Delivery Complexity Tiers:**
- **Basic:** Nearby sectors, wide time limits, low traffic
- **Standard:** Mid-range distance, moderate pressure
- **Rush:** Cross-city delivery, heavy traffic, tight deadlines
- **VIP:** Special clients in restricted areas, requires sector access

**Complications:**
- Traffic density varies by time of day
- Weather affects visibility and board handling
- Some sectors require bribes or credentials to enter
- Corporate drones scan for unlicensed couriers

## Found Quests & Side Content

### Street Courier Jobs

While riding, Jen encounters NPCs who need packages moved *fast* and *quietly*:

- **Desperate Office Worker:** "Please, this drive needs to reach my contact in District 4. The company can't know."
- **Street Vendor:** "My supplier's waiting, but I can't leave the stall. Get this to him and there's 200 creds in it for you."
- **Mysterious Figure:** "No questions. This case goes to the dead drop at Sector 7 maintenance shaft. You never saw me."

These jobs pay well but carry risk:
- Contents unknown (could attract corporate or gang attention)
- Delivery locations may be dangerous
- Failure has consequences (reputation, potential enemies)

### Salvage Runs

The dark zones and abandoned sectors are littered with pre-Cascade technology—valuable to the right buyer.

**Salvage Types:**
- **Power cells:** Upgrade components for your board
- **Data cores:** Sell to info brokers or decrypt for secrets
- **Drone parts:** Trade to mechanics or keep for repairs
- **Corp tech:** Risky to sell, but extremely valuable

**Salvage Zones:**
- Rooftops of abandoned buildings
- Crashed delivery drones
- Dead zones where grid failures left equipment behind
- Old transit tunnels (dangerous, high reward)

### Reputation & Contacts

Every job affects Jen's standing with the city's factions:

**Factions:**
- **Street Vendors Association:** Small business owners who stick together
- **Courier Collective:** Fellow independent riders (rivals and allies)
- **Underground Network:** Hackers, fixers, and information brokers
- **Sector Security:** Corporate police (best avoided)
- **The Disconnected:** Dark zone dwellers, off-grid and suspicious

Higher reputation unlocks:
- Better paying jobs
- Access to restricted areas
- Exclusive upgrades
- Story missions

## The World's Secrets

### Environmental Storytelling

The city tells its own story through:
- **Graffiti and street art** marking gang territories and hidden caches
- **Overheard conversations** between NPCs hinting at events and opportunities
- **News broadcasts** on public screens tracking city-wide developments
- **Abandoned locations** with logs and records from before the Cascade

### The Deeper Mystery

As Jen builds her reputation, she begins to uncover fragments of a larger truth:

- Why did the original grid fail?
- What really happened to her father?
- What are the corporations actually building beneath the city?
- Who is "The Architect" that street whispers mention?

The pizza delivery girl sees things. Goes places others can't. Talks to people on every level of society. She's in a unique position to piece together what's really happening in Neo Angeles—if she chooses to look.

## Tone & Feel

### Visual Identity
- **Neon and grime:** Bright lights reflecting off wet streets
- **Vertical city:** Towering buildings, multilevel roads, rooftop shortcuts
- **Contrast:** Gleaming corporate sectors vs. decaying dark zones
- **Weather:** Perpetual haze, occasional acid rain, rare clear days

### Gameplay Feel
- **Speed and flow:** Like Tony Hawk meets Mirror's Edge
- **Risk/reward:** Near-misses charge your board but one wrong move hurts
- **Freedom:** Choose your path through the city
- **Style matters:** How you ride is as important as whether you finish

### Audio Landscape
- **Synthwave and electronic** score that responds to speed
- **City ambiance:** Drones overhead, traffic below, distant sirens
- **Board sounds:** Hum of repulsors, crackle of energy discharge
- **Rico's shop:** Oldies playing on a battered radio

## Development Pillars

### 1. Movement is Joy
The hoverboard must feel incredible. Every input should feel responsive. Speed should feel dangerous. Near-misses should feel *electric*.

### 2. The City Lives
Traffic patterns. Pedestrians with routines. Drones with purposes. The world exists whether Jen is watching or not.

### 3. Every Run is a Story
Even a simple delivery can become an adventure. Random events, unexpected obstacles, and emergent moments create unique experiences.

### 4. Progression Through Exploration
The best upgrades aren't bought—they're found. The best jobs aren't posted—they're discovered. Reward curiosity.

### 5. Style Over Min-Maxing
There should never be one "optimal" route. Creative solutions should be rewarded. Looking cool should matter.

## Closing Notes

At its heart, NEON SLICE is about freedom—the freedom of movement, the freedom of choice, the freedom of a hoverboard and an open city. Jen isn't a soldier or a chosen one. She's a working-class kid trying to make rent in a world that stacked the deck against her.

But she's fast. She's smart. And she sees *everything*.

The pizza is just the beginning.

*"In a city where power is everything, the courier sees it all. And no one watches the delivery girl."*
